                While I'm still finishing up school (after taking some time off to work full-time), I spend my available time exploring emerging tech, making music, playing games, and meeting other passionate builders.

                Currently, I'm working with a friend (and former colleague) on bringing behavioral talent signals to the blockchain. More to come on this soon :)

                Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.edmit.me/">Edmit</a>, an ed-tech startup that helped students and families see college as an investment, rather than a cost. We shared an accurate estimate of what they'd pay each year, what their potential student loans would be, as well as how much they could earn given their major at that school. While at Edmit, I spent time as a software dev, working on the frontend and backend, data analyst, partnership manager, and content creator. It was awesome to try/learn so many new things.

                I've also worked at <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> as a retail specialist, <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> in IT.
